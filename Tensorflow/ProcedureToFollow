-1. select feature to be in row or column form
0. Identify the input and output
1. Draw the arcitecture of your neuron
2. Draw the computational graph
3. Identify the shape of weight and bias
4. write code

we will find weight and bias value for hidden layers
no. of node in output to the particular layer is the number of features.
no. of features is the number of columns in feature column form

output class is in column major form if our data is in column major form.
